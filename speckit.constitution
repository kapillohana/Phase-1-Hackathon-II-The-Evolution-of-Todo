# The Prompt for Claude Code - Evolution of Todo Project

## Core Philosophy: The Architect's Rule

### No Manual Edits
- The human is the Architect; the AI is the Builder. No code shall be written or modified manually.
- All changes must originate from updated specs in speckit.specify files.
- Manual coding is strictly forbidden - any code written directly by humans will be rejected.

### Spec-First
- Every feature or bug fix must start with an update to speckit.specify.
- No implementation can begin until speckit.tasks contains small, testable units of work.
- The specification drives the implementation, not the other way around.

### Atomic Tasks
- Tasks must be granular and testable units of work.
- Each task should be small enough to implement in a single session.
- No implementation can begin until speckit.tasks is complete and approved.

## Phase-Specific Tech Stack

| Component | Technology Standard |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Language/Runtime | Python 3.13+ (Backend), Node.js/TypeScript (Frontend) |
| Package Manager | uv for Python, pnpm or npm for JS |
| Backend Framework | FastAPI with SQLModel (Phase II+) |
| Frontend Framework | Next.js 16+ (App Router) |
| Database | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL |
| Auth | Better Auth (JWT-based, stateless) |
| Communication | Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI Agent tools |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube/AKS/GKE), Helm Charts |
| Middleware | Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) |

## Development Workflow (The Loop)

1. **Specify**: Define the "What" in Markdown. Include User Stories and Edge Cases in speckit.specify files.
2. **Plan**: Define the "How." Outline the folder structure, data models, and logic flow in speckit.plan files.
3. **Tasks**: Create a checklist of granular coding steps in speckit.tasks files.
4. **Implement**: Run `claude implement` based on the tasks in speckit.tasks.
5. **Verify**: Run tests. If they fail, go back to Specify or Plan; do not fix the code directly.

## Repository Structure Standards

- `/specs`: Must contain the history of all .specify, .plan, and .tasks files.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Must exist in every project root (and sub-roots like /frontend and /backend) to store build/test commands.
- `AGENTS.md`: Must document the AI agents and MCP tools used.

## Enforcement

- All team members must adhere to these standards.
- Code reviews will reject any pull requests that bypass the spec-driven workflow.
- The development loop must be followed religiously: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Verify.
- Violation of these standards will result in code rejection and requirement to restart using the proper workflow.
